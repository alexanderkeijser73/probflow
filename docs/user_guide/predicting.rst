TODO: how to predict w/ MAP estimates and predictive distributions (predict, predictive_distribution, and plot_predictive_distribution)

Any Model
---------

TODO: talk through how to use :class:`.Model`'s methods for prediction and sampling:

* predict
* log_prob / prob
* predictive_sample
* aleatoric_sample
* epistemic_sample
* pred_dist_plot

Continuous Model
----------------

TODO: talk through how to use

* predictive_interval
* aleatoric_interval
* epistemic_interval
* pred_dist_plot
* predictive_prc
