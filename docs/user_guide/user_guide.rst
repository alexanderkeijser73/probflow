For a quick start, take a look at the :doc:`../examples/examples`.

The user guide contains more detailed information about using ProbFlow, including:

- A brief description of :doc:`Bayesian modeling <inference>`,
- Using :doc:`distributions`, :doc:`parameters`, and :doc:`modules` to create Bayesian :doc:`models`,
- How to :doc:`fit those models <fitting>` to data,
- How to :doc:`make predictions <predicting>` with those models,
- How to :doc:`evaluate <evaluating>` the performance of a model,
- How to :doc:`inspect <inspecting>` a model's structure and the values of its parameters,
- How to use ProbFlow's :doc:`applications`,
- How to perform actions mid-training with :doc:`callbacks`,
- How to load data on-the-fly with :doc:`datagenerators`,
- How to :doc:`save and load models <saving_and_loading>`,
- How to :doc:`choose your backend and default datatype <backend>`, and
- :doc:`math` about how ProbFlow fits Bayesian models.
