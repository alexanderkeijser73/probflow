For a quick start, take a look at the :ref:`examples`.

The user guide contains more detailed information about Bayesian modeling with ProbFlow, including:

- A brief description of :ref:`Bayesian modeling <inference>`,
- How to create Bayesian models with ProbFlow using :ref:`parameters`, :ref:`layers`, and :ref:`distributions`,
- How to :ref:`fit those models <fitting>` to data,
- How to :ref:`use a fit model to make predictions <predicting>`,
- How to :ref:`evaluate <evaluating>` the performance of a fit model,
- How to :ref:`inspect <inspecting>` a model's structure and the values of its fit parameters,
- How to use several standard :ref:`ready_made_models` (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, etc), and
- :ref:`math` about how variational inference works (the type used by ProbFlow, at least).
