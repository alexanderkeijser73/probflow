# TODO: should inherit layer? model?  Layer, I think.
# but should incorporate the prior into the loss

# scale parameter should take a variable which has been transformed w/ softplus?
# that'll be inefficient tho, maybe just use ReLU?

# also should be able to declare variational variable vs normal variable
# variational=True arg?

# don't worry about bounds for now...
